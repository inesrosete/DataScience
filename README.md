### Data Exploration

*"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."​* - **Steve Jobs**


First of all let me introduce myself. I always had a curious and problem solver attitude and most likely this is the reason I pursued a research career. In the research field is mandatory to have grit, think first then act, and creativity and in my opinion all those characteristics are needed in a successful data scientist.

Due to this and all my previous professional experiences I am deepening my data skills through self learning. I have improved my Python knowledge through a Coursera course and in the last few months I have been improving my machine learning knowledge through online courses and Kaggle challenges.

Therefore, I decided to make public this repository, where you can find the Kaggle's challenges that I have been analyzing since Feb'18.

#### Outline

Ok! Let's fast-forward to the list of Codility's problems and Kaggle's challenges that I have analyzed:

  * [Codility's Problems](https://github.com/inesrosete/DataScience/blob/master/python_exercises.ipynb) - proposes possible solutions to Codility's challenges with different levels of difficulty

  * [Titanic Exploration](#) - like any data scientist this was my first Kaggle challenge and in this notebook I did feature engineering around raw titanic data; <img src="https://www.iconsdb.com/icons/preview/orange/star-8-xxl.png" width="10"> _(Available Soon)_ <img src="https://www.iconsdb.com/icons/preview/orange/star-8-xxl.png" width="10">

  * [Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://github.com/inesrosete/DataScience/blob/master/flight_delays_exploration.ipynb) - is a Kaggle challenge where the goal is to predict when a flight is delayed. I decided to split this notebook into two sections: data exploration / understanding and model iteration.

Let me know your thoughts regarding what I'm doing and I am available to discuss any question that you possible have.
